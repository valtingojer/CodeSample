# Strongly Typed Unity Strings

This packages generates static properties for the most used string features in unity

- [x] Axes (string only)
- [x] Layers (string and variant LayerInt with its integer value)
- [x] Scenes (string and variant LayerInt with its integer value)
- [x] SortingLayers (string and variant LayerInt with its integer value)
- [x] Tags (string only)

The code generation occurs at UnityEditor.Callbacks.DidReloadScripts

Also it creates a custom menu called StronglyTyped, where you can force the generation.

# Outputs

- [x] Properties are generated as static and get only
- Axes.your_axis
- Layers.your_layer
- Scenes.your_scene
- SortingLayers.your_sorting_layer
- Tags.your_tag
- [x] Enums are generated as well
- AxesEnum.your_axis
- LayersEnum.your_layer
- ScenesEnum.your_scene
- SortingLayersEnum.your_sorting_layer
- TagsEnum.your_tag

Enums are built with string = integer key pair, the string is the property name and integer is the property value, not having int value it uses the index as value.

# Menu Options

- Refresh all
- Delete all
- Change output folder

By default the files are saved at Assets/StronglyTypedAutoGenerated

If you choose another folder, you will need to manually delete the old files, and the setting will be saved at Editor/StronglyTyped/Settings/ as .data files

# Scenes

Only scenes who was previously added to SceneManager will be generate type.

You can do that by following:

File . Build Settings . Add open Scene || drag and drop a Scene into the list
